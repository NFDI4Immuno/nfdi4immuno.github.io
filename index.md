title: NFDI4Immuno
---

NFDI4Immuno is an initiative aiming to build an open infrastructure for FAIR research data management (RDM) focused on immunology as part of German National Research Data Infrastructure ([Nationale Forschungsdateninfrastruktur (NFDI)](https://www.nfdi.de/)).

Our vision is a network of federated repositories for all data describing the state of the immune system together with tools and services that will facilitate integrated data analyses across these repositories. Initially we focus on cytometry and adaptive immune receptor repertoire (AIRR) sequencing data.
