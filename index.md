# NFDI4Immuno

NFDI4Immuno is an initiative aiming to build an open and FAIR infrastructure for research data management focused on immunology as part of German NFDI ([National research Data Infrastructure](https://www.nfdi.de/)).

Our vision is a network of federated repositories for all data describing the state of the immune system together tools and services that will facilitate integrated data analyses across these repositories. Initially we focus on cytometry, sequence data describing the adaptive immune receptor repertoire.
